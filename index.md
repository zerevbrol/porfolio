<summary>My experience which has given me the greatest depth and breadth of work!</summary>
<p>
{{ "
in the visual material division, I have processed, rehoused, and worked with thousands of photographs across more than thirty collections. I am particularly proud of my work processing and arranging the personal photographs and materials of the 'Boys in the Boat' coxswain, Robert Moch.

you can check out the finding aid for the Moch collection [here](https://archiveswest.orbiscascade.org/ark:80444/xv791503?q=moch).

I've also processed some other notable collections at the UW, including the [C.W. Felch photograph collection](https://archiveswest.orbiscascade.org/ark:80444/xv325025), the [Webster & Stevens photograph collection](https://archiveswest.orbiscascade.org/ark:80444/xv505991), and the [Western Canada photograph collection](https://archiveswest.orbiscascade.org/ark:80444/xv92150).

in the architecture drawings division, I am rehousing the architecture drawings collection of Carl Gould Sr., the first licensed architect in Washington state. I have taken disparate drawings and rearranged them into one cohesive map case set, using highly-technical skills for moving delicate, century-old work.

## independent archival consulting | 2023-

<summary>What has given me the confidence to try to become a professional archivist?</summary>
<p>
{{ "
my Seattle-area clients have run the gamut!

for a small local arts archive, I have leveraged my skills in policy creation to create dynamic processing manuals and strategic planning. my work also focused on alignment with grant funder guidelines and professional development trainings for staff at the archive.

my individual clients have included rare book collectors and subject-area collection specialists. for these clients, I've produced finding aids for a varied collection of rare books, ephemera, and manuscripts, culminating in donation to the Rare Books Division of the University of Washington Libraries. 

I've also assessed and assited in the valuation of a collection of rare 20th century American literature. I've conducted informal research and market analysis of materials, prepared descriptive materials for the collection's auction site, and communicated timely, accurate evaluation to stakeholders.

## skills and other accolades
<details>
<summary>All the cool skills I've learned during my time at UW!</summary>
<p>
{{ "
throughout my time at the university, I've set out to improve a number of my archival soft skills, including my object handling procedure and preventative conservation practices. Working with patrons has improved my library front-of-house best practices and standards, including policy creation and administrative procedures, including (de-) accessioning, acquisition, and conservation. I've updated and improved my processing procedures for nitrate, acetate, and polyester film and accompanying print media, as well as encoding procedures in DACS, EAD, ASpace, and their implementation in XMetal. I've also learned how to make some [pretty nifty phase wrappers]()!

I have also iterated on my skill related grant writing and funding, as well as the handling of materials and grants. I also improved my interdisciplinary and critical research strategies by gaining experience with community co-created methodologies!
