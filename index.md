## the gist
this site acts as my portfolio, an overview of some of the work I'm proudest of. also check out [my github](https://github.com/zerevbrol) for related personal projects that might not have made it here to the big leagues.

## chihuly studio, inc. | 2025-
organizing the personal papers of Dale Chihuly, the preeminent glass artist and pioneer of the studio glass movement. there, I work with corporate records and personal papers, as well as audio-visual materials. the work I do, and content I create, is privileged information, but here are some photos from my workspace.

## university of washington libraries, special collections | 2022-
in the visual material division, I have processed, rehoused, and worked with thousands of photographs across more than thirty collections. I am particularly proud of my work processing and arranging the personal photographs and materials of the 'Boys in the Boat' coxswain, Robert Moch.

you can check out the finding aid for the Moch collection [here](https://archiveswest.orbiscascade.org/ark:80444/xv791503?q=moch).

I've also processed some other notable collections at the UW, including the [C.W. Felch photograph collection](https://archiveswest.orbiscascade.org/ark:80444/xv325025), the [Webster & Stevens photograph collection](https://archiveswest.orbiscascade.org/ark:80444/xv505991), and the [Western Canada photograph collection](https://archiveswest.orbiscascade.org/ark:80444/xv92150).

in the architecture drawings division, I am rehousing the architecture drawings collection of Carl Gould Sr., the first licensed architect in Washington state. I have taken disparate drawings and rearranged them into one cohesive map case set, using highly-technical skills for moving delicate, century-old work.

## independent archival consulting | 2023-
working with a variety of clients with different archival scopes.
