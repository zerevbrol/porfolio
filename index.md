in the visual material division, I have processed, rehoused, and worked with thousands of photographs across more than thirty collections. I am particularly proud of my work processing and arranging the personal photographs and materials of the 'Boys in the Boat' coxswain, Robert Moch.

you can check out the finding aid for the Moch collection [here](https://archiveswest.orbiscascade.org/ark:80444/xv791503?q=moch).

I've also processed some other notable collections at the UW, including the [C.W. Felch photograph collection](https://archiveswest.orbiscascade.org/ark:80444/xv325025), the [Webster & Stevens photograph collection](https://archiveswest.orbiscascade.org/ark:80444/xv505991), and the [Western Canada photograph collection](https://archiveswest.orbiscascade.org/ark:80444/xv92150).

in the architecture drawings division, I am rehousing the architecture drawings collection of Carl Gould Sr., the first licensed architect in Washington state. I have taken disparate drawings and rearranged them into one cohesive map case set, using highly-technical skills for moving delicate, century-old work.

my clients have run the gamut in the Seattle area!

for a small local arts archive, I have leveraged my skills in policy creation to create dynamic processing manuals and strategic planning. my work also focused on alignment with grant funder guidelines and professional development trainings for staff at the archive.

my individual clients have included rare book collectors and subject-area collection specialists. for these clients, I've produced finding aids for a varied collection of rare books, ephemera, and manuscripts, culminating in donation to the Rare Books Division of the University of Washington Libraries. I've also assessed and assited in the valuation of a collection of rare 20th century American literature. I've conducted informal research and market analysis of materials, prepared descriptive materials for the collection's auction site, and communicated timely, accurate evaluation to stakeholders.
